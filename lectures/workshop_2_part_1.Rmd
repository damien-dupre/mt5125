# Anatomy of JAMOVI

.pull-left[
#### 1. Different symbols for **variable types**
]
.pull-right[
```{r out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/jamovi_icons.png")
```
]

#### 2. Expected variable type is displayed in bottom right corner of boxes

Distinction between **Factors** and **Covariates**:
  - A Factor is a predictor of type categorical (nominal or ordinal)
  - A Covariate is a predictor of type continuous

#### 3. Type of actions
  - Drag and drop variables
  - Selection arrow
  - Unfolding boxes to reach options

# 1. Latent Variables and Reliability Analysis

---

# Latent Variable

In order to measure the theoretical constructs/concepts of your model, you will have to select the best measurement scale made of multiple items.

Reliability assessment is performed every time a scale is used (Cronbach's alpha)

Cronbach's alpha indicates the overall correlation between items

Cronbach's alpha ranges from -1 to 1:

- If its value is higher than 0.7, then the scale is reliable to measure the latent variable 
- If its value is lower than 0.7, then proceed with caution or remove/modify the scale to obtain a value higher than 0.7

---

# Cronbach's alpha in JAMOVI

In the Analysis Tab:
1. Click Factor icon
2. Select Reliability Analysis

```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_1.png")
```

In our example, alpha = -0.56: This is not enough and something is wrong
---

# Cronbach's alpha in JAMOVI - Solution 1

Have a look at the Cronbach's alpha if item is dropped

```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_4.png")
```

---

# Cronbach's alpha in JAMOVI - Solution 2

Have a look at the correlation heatmap
- If one item is negatively correlated with the others (values < 0 and red colour), this item is reversed and has to be recoded
- Add the negatively correlated item to “Reverse Scaled Item" to observe the effect of changes

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_2.png")
```

---

# Cronbach's alpha in JAMOVI - Solution 2

Have a look at the correlation heatmap
- If one item is negatively correlated with the others (values < 0 and red colour), this item is reversed and has to be recoded
- Add the negatively correlated item to “Reverse Scaled Item" to observe the effect of changes

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_3.png")
```

# Manually Recode Variable

.pull-left[
Some scales include negative formulation of some items to check that participants are reading the questions.

For example in a Job Satisfaction scale:
- It. 1: I love my job
- It. 2: I like going to work everyday
- It. 3: I hate what I'm doing at work

If I answer high to the 2 first items, my answer to the 3rd item should be low.

The values of an item from 0 to 10 has to be reversed:
- 0 becomes 10
- 1 becomes 9
- ...
- 10 becomes 0
]

.pull-right[
```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_5.png")
```
]

# Manually Recode Variable

In Jamovi:
- Data > Transform: edit
```
= (max scale + min scale) - variable
```

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_6.png")
```

---

# Manually Recode Variable

In Jamovi:
- Data > Compute Variable
```
= (max scale + min scale) - variable
```

```{r out.width='80%'}
include_graphics("img/cronbach_8.png")
```

---

# Compute Latent Variable Score

When Cronbach's alpha is satisfying enough, then calculate the latent variable score by averaging the items kept and reversed (don't include original items if they have been reversed)

# Describing the Distribution of Variables

In an Academic Research Paper, once the latent variables are calculated, basic statistical summaries are calculated and presented in a text:

```

# Correlation Matrix with Predictors

```{r out.width='100%'}
include_graphics("img/jamovi_correlation_matrix.png")
```

---

# $p$-hacking in Correlation Matrices

The use of correlation tables is widespread in the literature, and they are a great tool for descriptive analysis but **do not test your hypotheses with correlation matrices**. A good practice is to remove all $p$-values or $p$-stars from them.

$p$-values should only be produced to test an hypothesis that has been already formulated, any other is use is called $p$**-hacking**.

## Exercise: Descriptive Statistics

Use the data file "manager_satisfaction_performance.csv" in Jamovi to:
- Evaluate the reliability of the 3 scales
- Calculate the score for each scale
- Produce descriptive tables and figures from the latent variables according to the gender variable 
- Produce the correlation matrix of the Predictors Monthly-contract-negociated, Stress and Turnover Intentions

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 15, warn_when = 60)
```
