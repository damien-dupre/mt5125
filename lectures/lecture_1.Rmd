- #### Data Analytics  (70%): Individual Assessment: Data Analytic Report

### Data Analytics Assessment

- Write-up a report fully documenting the results of a systematic quantitative analysis of a dataset (send to you by email in January)

- This will require the use of a statistical software (e.g., JAMOVI)

- You will illustrate your understanding about the full quantitative analysis process including: 
 - Running descriptive statistics, including tables and graphics
 - Assessing multi-item scale internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha)
 - Using bivariate and multivariate inferential statistics

# What are Big Data?

### Definition

The term Big Data corresponds to a table containing observations (i.e. database or dataset) that is **too long, too large or too complex to be handled by conventional tools**

### Microsoft Excel's Limits (v16.44 - Office 365):

- Total number of rows: **1,048,576 rows**
- Total number columns: **16,384 columns**

# Data vs. Information

Without data, an organization could not successfully complete most business activities. However, organisations need to convert these data into meaningful information

- Data consists of raw facts
- Information is often confused with the term data

### Example: Sales Manager
- Knowing number of sales for each representative (fact – data)
- Knowing total monthly sales (transformed – information)

```{nomnoml, fig.width=12, fig.height=3}
#stroke: black
#direction: right
#align: center
[Data]->[Transformation Process]
[Transformation Process]->[Information]
```

# Value of Information

- **Goals**: Helps decision makers achieve organisational goals
- **Performance**: Valuable information helps people and organisations perform
- **Accuracy**: Inaccurate/Incomplete information leads to Poor Decisions and can result in High Cost for the organisation 

--

### Data Analytics
- The science of using data to build models that lead to better decisions that in turn add value to individuals, companies and institutions
- The analysis of data, typically large sets of data, by the use of mathematics, statistics, and computer software

Whether the goal is improved enhanced customer service, reduced operating costs, or any other improvement initiative; success demands:
- A very skilful general management and change management
- A clear vision of the desired future state
- A compelling strategic argument for achieving the future state

# Strategic Importance of Data Analytics

Over the past 20 years, Data Analytics has proven to be highly useful in improving many different business processes:

- Management processes—like strategic planning, budgeting, performance measurement, controlling, and performance variance analysis.

- Revenue generation processes—like market research, customer segmentation, sales planning, revenue budgeting and management,
pricing, promotions planning and execution, product development, service development, customer order processing, and so forth.

- Operating processes—like purchasing, supplier management, inbound logistics, manufacturing, operations, inventory management,
distribution centre management, outbound logistics, quality assurance, order fulfilment, customer service, and so forth.

A well-designed BI environment serves as a powerful multifaceted tool for performance measurement and process improvement.

# Styles of Data Analytics

It uses a combination of historical information about past transactions or events and reference data about, for example, customers or products, to enable a wide variety of analyses and decision support techniques.

- **Standard Reports:** Preformatted information for predefined backward-looking analysis. 

- **Academic Reports:** Application of research methods to business information  using descriptive and inferential statistics.

- **Dashboards:** Business performance metrics using specific variables presented in a tabular or graphical format.

- **Alerts:** Communication to designated business people when a key business variable is outside a predefined performance standard or range.

- **Predictive Analytics:** Application of historical business information to predict future the performance and potentially prescribe a favoured course of action.

---

# Data Analytics in Academic Reports

Standard Reports can be insufficient tools to validate the results provided by Data Analytics. To insure the robustness of the insights generated, Academic Reports are structured around the Hypothetico-Deductive model.

In Academic Reports, all sections are linked:

.center[**Introduction `r ji("right_arrow")` Literature Review `r ji("right_arrow")` Method `r ji("right_arrow")` Results `r ji("right_arrow")` Discussion & Conclusion**]

--

To understand the statistics in the results section it is essential to identify the concepts presented in each section:

```{nomnoml, fig.width=12, fig.height=3}
#stroke: black
#direction: right
#align: center
[Introduction | Variables]->[Literature Review | Hypotheses]
[Literature Review | Hypotheses]->[Method | Model & Equation]
[Method | Model & Equation]->[Results | Statistical Test]
[Results | Statistical Test]->[Discussion & Conclusion | Interpretation]
```
