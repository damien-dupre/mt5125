# Previoulsy ...

We have seen how to structure an Academic Report introduction:
- By declaring the variables you want to investigate (they have specific types and roles)
- By ending it with a research question that include these variables

We have seen how to structure an Academic Report literature review:
- It consists in summarising the research that has already been conducted using these variables
- It has to explicitly end with your hypotheses (even if in some academic report are more implicit)

Now it is time to represent the model that will be statistically tested and to deduce its corresponding equation
---

# Model & Equation

A graphic representation of the model's hypothesised effects can be done:
- All the arrows correspond to an hypothesis to be tested
- All the tested hypotheses have to be represented with an arrow

.pull-left[
.center[**A simple arrow is a main effect**]

```{r eval=TRUE}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
digraph rmarkdown {
  graph [rankdir = LR]
  
  node [shape = box]
  Predictor; Outcome
        
  Predictor -> Outcome [label= b1]
}
", width = 400, height = 200)
```

]

.pull-right[

.center[**A crossing arrow is an interaction effect**]

```{r}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
  digraph {
    graph [rankdir = LR]
  
    node [shape = box]
    'Predictor 1'; Outcome; 'Predictor 2'
    node [shape = point, width = 0, height = 0]
    ''
    
    'Predictor 2' -> '' [label= b2]
    'Predictor 1' -> '' [arrowhead = none] [label= b1]
    ''-> Outcome [label= b3]
    
    subgraph {
      rank = same; 'Predictor 2'; '';
    }
  }", height = 200, width = 400)
```

.center[Note: By default, an interaction effect involves the test of the main effect hypotheses of all Predictors involved]
